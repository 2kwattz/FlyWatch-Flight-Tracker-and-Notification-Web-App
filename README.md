# FlyWatch-Flight-Tracker-and-Notification-Web-App

## UNDER DEVELOPMENT
Track any fight with the help of ICAO Code. Alpha check Bearing, Range and Altitude on yourfingertips. Get Call and Email based notification for your favourite flights for Civilian and MIlitary aircrafts such as C17s, il76s etc appearing within custom radius of your city for our fellow planespotters.

Work on Python CLI based script will start first as a prototype for the web application in cli scripts folder.

### CORE PURPOSE

The Tango aim of this project is to create a program that will alert plane spotters of their favourite aircrafts and potentially providing its Intel location via an automated call as well as other means such 
as emails and asking them to reach the photographing spot before the ETA of the military jet. Some military planes such as the Charlie 17s have shorter stint of maximum 2 hours before scraming at other airforce stations.
For Military Aviation enthusiasts this could be a huge setback as I myself missed few of my spotting sessions for this simple reason.

That is : Most of the military aircrafts have negative contact in some of the fight radar apps. So If you are not present at the right time, right place with your right camera settings .
You will not get the perfect shot. Airforce works in secrecy, Most of the best things such as when Sierra Echo Papa Echo Charlie Alpha Tango Jaguar fighterjet visited Vadodara happened quite unexpectedly
Some of these rare jets are visible on one platform but not on other and vice versa. As a result, It is extremely difficult to predict its ETA as well.

Some of these jets arrive once in 8 months to max to max 6 years, And not every planespotter has time to hook up to Foxtrot Romeo Two Four,Radarbox, ADBS Exchange 24x7. 
Also 6 years is a very long time for a fellow planespotter to witness his aircraft girlfriend with its full mighty engines roaring, 7000 RPM taking off after such a long time.

This is a flight tracker & notification sender from a planespotter to planespotters for planespotting! We Got This.

Prepare for the Lima Oscar November Golf End of Time. Over.
